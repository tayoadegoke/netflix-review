## About

This project allows a user to view various movie trailers and also lets logged in users give a review of the movie in form of comments.

## How to Run it locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Create a .env file in the root directory and copy all environment variables from .env.example file and replace values with your own values.

If the backend is running, you can start the front end by running
